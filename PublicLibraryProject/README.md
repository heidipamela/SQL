This project consists of the creation of a database for a Public Library. First I started creating a server in docker, and a database, to which I connected with IntelijIdea. 
Then, I proceded to create the tables and insert information.
Later on, I proceeded to verify the data with some join operations. Afterwards, I ran several queries in order to analyze this data and understand the information obtained
through the same.
